      p Having pretty much gone our separate ways, musically and otherwise, it fell on Rog to continue something.
      p From 1996 or so, there are recordings of other songs by Rog on his own, under the bizarrely name of <i>BEDOUIN</i>.
      p A CD was sent off to producers,  with one reply being that the songs were not 'jolly enough' â€“ at a time of Radiohead !
