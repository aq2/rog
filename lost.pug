      p After moving to Ottery in early 2001, a little spell of between-band creation was then recorded by Rog, at Tony's tidy home based studio. Then thankfully, a recall back to the fetrilt ground of the mid-nineties became apparent â€“ SNITW Drummer, Chris Durant, got in touch, running a few new creations together in Chris' Silverton home garage.
      
      p We gave Ian McCord from the same village a shout. He'd been writing his own good stuff but was happy to join us. He proved to be a natural on the bass, finding and applying the classy background tuneful glue to what became LOSTOMBRES - god knows where that name came from but it stuck for a while!
      
      p After some searching in Exeter music shops, we were then joined by the Fender-bending skank-fan, Big Ian 'Barefoot' Davey, from Exmouth on lead guitar. There started around 2-3 years of rehearsing and quite a few gigs from Taunton to St Austell and beyond. From this band, following a 7 song CD recording at a studio near Silverton in 2003 there then came roughly 4 CDs worth of songs,recorded by the semi-legendary talented sound engineer/producer and musician Jon Smith in the garage and some Live. The greatest hits being chosen for the 12 song CD <i>'Permanency'</i>. This included a cover of Dolly Parton's <i>Jolene</i>, and a classy number bequeathed by old Dave Cox called <i>Wheels</i>.

      p Our charity Everest Climb fundraising Talaton gig (with live recording from Jon) included a slightly crazy banjo-jinxed version of <i>Born To be Wild</i>, which certainly raised some eyebrows - heavenward perhaps!
