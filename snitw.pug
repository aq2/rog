      p The band's story started in 1992, with Rog Hunt (guitar) and Julie Matthews (vocals and flute). Rog mainly knew 70s/80s rock and post punk (with a bit of Dylan and Nick Cave thrown in). He had hardly sung and was still dismayed at not being able to ape the rock guitar of Hendrix or Heavy Metal heroes! Julie, having run the folk club at Swansea Uni, was heavily skilled in English and Irish folk songs - both vocally and on the flute. This, strangely enough, was a good mix and had potential…
      
      p After Rog realised that he was better at writing a reasonable bit of strange chord guitar shenanigans to Julie's lyrics than teaching, the pair of them hacked up to East Devon from Brixham after Rog leaving teaching for the good of all, with a Jawa and a side-car.
      
      p They started attending a few Folk Nights, roughly performing Irish, Welsh and English folk songs learned from a couple of Julie's books. It was a good breeding ground. Things had to tighten up whilst playing live together to a bunch of strangers!
      
      p Some early sessions also featured a few self-penned numbers with Matthew Smith (briefly on bass and recording), Ian Richardson (on keys for a short while) and Nick Martin playing fiddle and electric guitar.
      
      p This got the attention of a local recording studio, Daylight Music. Ian Dent recorded our first 3 track session and put a song called <i>The Mirror</i> (lyrics/tune by Julie and rest by Rog) on a compilation of 24 Devon Bands, with the risqué coastal-rock title <i>Long and Pink</i>!

      p By the time the CD was released, the line-up had changed: Matthew was on his way to Australia. The others advertised in local papers and music stores (no social media then!), and were soon gifted replies from Chris Durant (a tidy drummer) and Rob Hills, a talented Sidmothian bass player.
 
      p The five of us started rehearsing other songs written between Rog (who had begun exploring ways to make songs from a loose imagination and the most unusual chords in his guitar book) and Julie's tune-smithery and writing skills.

      p But then we had to find A NAME, always a brain-teaser for any band, and ours was no exception. Rog had recently read and loved Stella Gibbons' strange and comic book <i>Cold Comfort Farm</i>, featuring the Starkadders and the quote <i>'Something Nasty in the Woodshed'</i>. Rog suggested this and the others agreed, and the name has mostly stuck in some form, even to this day! Before long, weird monster-headed t-shirts were in production…

      p Something Nasty were kind of lucky, early on somehow making contact with Exeter's Cavern Club who needed a band to test the venue's acoustics and mixing desk! Often rehearsing twice a week, the songs came a-flowing and gigs were found. The former 'Sleeper' in Seaton was a favourite with locals who knew us, filling the place good and rowdy.

      p All good things come to an end though and, without ever discovering what was ultimately unidentifiable in the woodshed, Something Nasty reached a signing-off time in mid 1995: Relationships changed, and Nick moved to Wales.

      p Luckily, through the magic of the interwebs, their songs are still accessible on the right hand side of this very page!
